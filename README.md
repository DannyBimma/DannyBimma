Hello World, 

My name, as recognised by the government of Barbados is Daniel Trotman. But I call myself DannyBimma, or just Danny for short. If you’re a monolinguist in the English language, you’re probably confused as to why I made a distinction between my name and what I call myself. But if you’re familiar with the Spanish language, you’ll know that they ask “¿Cómo se llama?”. Most people assume this translates to “What’s your name?”, but that’s one of those “sentiment equivalent” translations, a translation that’s widely accepted because it correctly conveys the sentiment. A direct translation would actually be “What do you call yourself?”. The reason I’m mentioning all of this in what’s supposed to be a quick self-introduction, is not merely to be pedantic. It serves as practical insight into the way my mind works… by being pedantic. That should tell you most of what you need to know about the way I approach writing and reading code 😁 !!

p.s. there are way to many software developers named Daniel, it’s inevitable that we’ll eventually reach a developer singularity where all software devs are just people named Daniel.



## Interests
* Web Development

The thought of willingly creating an array of complex problems for myself to solve on behalf of building things for other people would’ve been absolutely bonkers to me 2.5 years ago, but now, it’s just kinda strange! 
For 28 years I lived my life and never even experienced a fleeting thought of being  a software developer, but then in the year 2020 something happened and my whole world got flipped turned upside down. The “you know what” caused me to be quickly out of my job as Storeroom Clerk at the Coconut Court Beach Hotel in the beautiful island of Barbados. This turned out to be massively unfortunate as I had been working and saving as much as possible to start my own business (something I’d wanted to do since I was a wee little lad) 🙋🏽‍♂️
Long story slightly less long, the business I wanted to start would’ve been built around a fairly complex website to provide a sorely needed service for my island. As I no longer had the money to pay a competent engineer/s their worth to build such a website, I had to train myself to become one. And so started my dev journey and the discovery of my love for all things code, a love that went hitherto unexplored!

* SaaSy Entrepreneurship 

As mentioned above, I’ve long had the desire to start to an eCom focused business in my beautiful island nation of Barbados and, I recently started the process  of becoming a self-taught full-stack developer about 2 years ago. These 2 things collided and birthed an idea to develop a SaaS that would benefit end users in an invaluable way. 
The end users in this case being all citizens of and visitors on the island. I can’t go into much detail in this “about me read-me” but, rest assured that it’s a MASSIVE undertaking for someone young in their developer journey such as myself. As a result, I’m currently engaged in freelance development work building smaller projects as I hone the skills needed to build my own 👨🏾‍💻

* Sports & Entertainment

Formula 1 is my favourite sport and Scuderia Ferrari is my favourite sports team on the planet! I could gush on about my love for F1 and Ferrari in a .txt file big enough to crash your browser’s local storage… but I plan to build a web blog for exactly that at a later date 😅
My other sporting interests are in football and basketball, and my heart cheers for Manchester United and the Miami Heat respectively. The interests I maintain in sports also coincides with, or maybe gave rise to the physical activities I’m most interested in. Which are enjoying scrimmage sessions of football and basketball as often as possible. And whenever I’m in possession of a vehicle, it’s guaranteed that I’ll be tinkering under the hood at least 3 to 5 times a week regardless of the vehicle’s working condition.

## 🚀 Current Dev Status
I'm a full stack developer...

Or at least that’s what I’ll be constantly working towards. I recently saw a joke being circulated in the dev community that goes, “there’s no such thing as a full-stack developer, only back-end developers who know a little CSS.” 
And that’s terrifyingly true!!
One of the first and most important lessons you learn as a developer is that you’ll never stop learning. Discovering the joy of building things with lines of code is something I’m glad I’ve found. 
So glad in fact,  that I’m certain I never want to do anything else. My current ambition to build something that could positively impact an entire country is my sole focus right now. And in pursuing it I know I’ll attain a valuable library of knowledge, skill, and experience. Not attaining that goal could very realistically mean “only managing” to land a job at a major tech company and contributing to positively impacting the lives of millions instead. Which is not so bad innit 😁 !

My government name is Daniel Trotman, but the sheer amount of software engineers who share my name is slightly concerning. As a result, I use the nickname DannyBimma for all my socials excluding LinkedIn 🙂

## 🚀 About Me
A full stack & aspiring mobile developer...

I’m currently a self employed web developer and consultant. Which means it’s my job to advise and assist small businesses/start-ups with their online presence and web services. I strive to effectively acquire customers and clients for the businesses/people I work with. To accomplish this I build websites/web-apps that harness the power of the web to attract and satisfy target audiences. Here is where I upload the source code to most of the projects I work on. 


Most recently I’ve taken a strong interest in native iOS app development using Swift and Xcode. I plan to document as much of my learning journey as possible for anyone’s perusal 👨🏽‍💻


## Tech Stack

**Client:** Vanilla JavaScript, Raw HTML, Pure CSS, BootStrap, & SwiftUI.

**Server:** Node.js, Express & MongoDB.

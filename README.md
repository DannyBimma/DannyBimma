- 👋 Hello fellow human, or advanced alien, there's really no way to discern who's all up on GitHub. Anyway I'm yet another developer named Daniel, but on the World Wide Webs I call myself @DannyBimma.
- 👀 I’m very interested in learning as much about web / app development as my cerebral cortex can comfortably contain. And while I'm assimilating said knowledge, I'll be pining to deploy my learnings modularly and evenutally create some manner of SaaS geared towards helping my fellow humans.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced JavaScript as well as advanced Node.js... Although I'm not entirely sure how much weight the term "advanced" carries with those two technologies, but some of the concepts I learned were complex enough to put stress fractures on my IQ.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... anything that's not illegal really. Heck even then!!
- 📫 When I'm finally finished building my personal portfolio the world will be able to reach me there!!

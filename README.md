My government name is Daniel Trotman, but the sheer amount of software engineers who share my name is slightly concerning. As a result, I call myself DannyBimma ðŸ™‚

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a software engineer in training...

I got my introduction into the tech industry through code along tutourials and udemy courses, and eventually I learned how to write code. But I wanted to build things with code that weren't broken down in step-by-step online videos, so I decided it was time to learn how to program.  


## Tech Stack

**Client:** C, Python, Vanilla JavaScript.

**Server:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB.
